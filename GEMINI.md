# Project Overview

This is a web application built with [UmiJS](https://umijs.org/), a React-based framework for enterprise-level applications. The project uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the user interface, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database management (with a SQLite backend), and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for data fetching and state management.

The application features a basic layout with three main sections:

- A home page that displays a user selection component.
- An access control page (implementation not fully explored).
- A user management page with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users.

The backend API is expected to be running separately and provides endpoints for user management.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) are required.

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Database Seeding

To seed the database with initial data, run:

```bash
pnpm seed
```

## Development Conventions

### Code Style

The project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. To format the code, run:

```bash
pnpm format
```

### API Interaction

API requests are managed through auto-generated functions in `src/services/demo/UserController.ts`. These functions are generated by a tool called "OneAPI". The API endpoints are expected to be available at `/api/v1`.

### Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Any changes to the database schema should be made in this file, followed by a database migration.
